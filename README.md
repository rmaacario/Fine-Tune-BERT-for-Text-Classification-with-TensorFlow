# Fine-Tune-BERT-for-Text-Classification-with-TensorFlow
This repository provides a guide and code examples to preprocess text for BERT, build TensorFlow input pipelines for text data, and fine-tune BERT for text classification using TensorFlow 2 and TensorFlow Hub. This project is a version of the Coursera Guided project [https://www.coursera.org/projects/fine-tune-bert-tensorflow] to work with the latest available versions of TensorFlow-Hub.
