# Fine-Tune-BERT-for-Text-Classification-with-TensorFlow
This repository provides a guide and code examples to preprocess text for BERT, build TensorFlow input pipelines for text data, and fine-tune BERT for text classification using TensorFlow 2 and TensorFlow Hub.

Text classification with fine-tuned BERT model using TensorFlow

"Fine_Tune_BERT_for_Text_Classification_with_TensorFlow.ipynb" is a notebook that shows how to fine-tune BERT for text classification using TensorFlow and TensorFlow-Hub. It is a modified version of the Coursera Guided project ([https://www.coursera.org/projects/fine-tune-bert-tensorflow]) to work with the latest available versions of TensorFlow-Hub.
